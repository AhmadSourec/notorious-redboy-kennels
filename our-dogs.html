                PRIME is a greatly loved, devoted member of our family. He stands guard inside
                the front door of our house all night long. He's a very well disciplined dog who
                immediately follows commands. He is gentle with children, as evidenced by the
                photo of our granddaughter giving him a pedicure! Prime is our primary stud dog,
                who brings the very tight BARRACUDA and MAYDAY blood to his descendants.

            <h2>
                WALLACE'S NOTORIOUS MAXIMUS
            </h2>
            <h4>
                NOTORIOUS MAXIMUS IS THE GREAT GRANDSON OF THE GREAT BOOMER ROM
            </h4>
            <p>
                MAXIMUS comes from Pit Island Kennels, an established leader in preserving this
                authentic lineage which can be traced back to the eighteenth century. We feel so
                fortunate to have been able to partner with them. </p>
            <p>
                Maximus' bloodline was made possible by breeder Katie Marlowe in 1983, when she
                bred Fanny (a double bred granddaughter of Bass Tramp RedBoy) back to RedBoy.
                This resulted in Bingo, a PURE REDBOY dog! This is the bloodline that the followers of
                real Pitbulls revere and value so highly. The opportunity to own a dog with this pure a
                bloodline is unprecedented today. These are the antithesis of designer dogs and bully
                dogs. We take great pride in preserving AUTHENTIC PITBULLS for future generations.

            </h2>

            <p>
                MERCEDES is our gorgeous, red nosed blonde who comes from a powerhouse
                lineage. She is the strongest female in our kennel. She is very active and full of
                energy, but is gentle with people. She excels at jumping and agility exercises. Her
                puppies are just like her. They should be great performers at dog shows and
                athletic contests.

                WALLACE'S SHEBA
            </h2>

            <p>
                SHEBA is our awesome petite Hollingsworth dog...full of fire! Hollingsworth dogs
                make excellent family companions. They also excel at many canine athletic sports
                such as treadmill racing, dock diving, agility, high jump, and personal protection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheba adores people, and is her owner's favorite companion. She is gentle with
                children, and is a caring mother who is very devoted to her puppies. Despite her
                good nature, she is the Alpha dog of our entire kennel. She is smaller than our other
                dogs, yet they all defer to her. Sheba is so obedient that she will sit and wait for
                her owners without being leashed, but will never back down when challenged by
                another dog. She has all of the best qualities a family pet could possess.

                newest addition to our family, but has quickly become the Star Female. She is very
                happy, and is an absolute joy to be around. Everyone who meets her, ends up falling
                in love with her. </p>
